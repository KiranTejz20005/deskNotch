/**
 * The machine's load, for the Right now card's Usage page: CPU, GPU and
 * memory. Nothing here runs unless that page is showing.
 *
 * - CPU and memory: Node's own `os`, read on request. CPU is the share of
 *   busy time since the previous request, so the first reading is a guess.
 * - GPU: Windows' performance counter, read by one PowerShell kept alive while
 *   the page keeps asking, and killed a few seconds after it stops. It is what
 *   Task Manager shows: the busiest engine type (3D, video decode…), since one
 *   adapter has several and they add past 100.
 *
 * ponytail: the counter path is the English name, which is what Windows
 * exposes; on a Windows in another language it does not resolve, and GPU reads
 * as unavailable while CPU and memory still work.
